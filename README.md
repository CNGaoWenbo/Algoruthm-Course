# Algoruthm-Course
There are programming assignments for an Algorithm course on a MOOC platform. 

The length of input arrays mostly range from (0,10^5), the number range from (0,10^9). The run time limit is 5.0s.

To prevent copying codes to pass the exam and get the certificate, I will not release whihc MOOC platfor or course name.

Therefore, the puzzle description documents will not be upload. 

If you are interested in my codes and want a full description, please ask in 'issues'.
